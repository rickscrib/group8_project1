OMDB Analysis and Visualization

Here on my branch is work and outputs for my analysis of runtimes of oscar-winning movies. The file "Runtime.ipynb" is my final analysis. "api.ipynb", "df_merge.ipynb", "project1_API.ipynb", and "project1_clean.ipynb" were used to make the initial API request and clean the data. "Resources" contains the data in various stages of cleaning, with the final version used for my analysis being "runtime_clean.csv". "Resources" also contains the output .png files for my visualizations.
